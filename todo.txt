	per story if there are multiple stories
graph of posts with score, number of comments and number of messages sent/pending
edit fields for
	subscription prompts


check that user or subreddit name is
add readme
r/hfy should prompt be stickied
r/nosleep can I post prompt
tags from new series should prompt whether to message everyone
remove new from footer
if a post is deleted, cancel pending notifications for it
move tags to their own class
multi user subscriptions
multi subreddit subscriptions
