pushshift why? page
does replying to a message mark it as read
r/hfy should prompt be stickied
r/nosleep can I post prompt
tags from new series should prompt whether to message everyone
blacklist certain subs
active author polls

graph of subscribers over time
	per story if there are multiple stories
graph of posts with score, number of comments and number of messages sent/pending
edit fields for
	subscription prompts
